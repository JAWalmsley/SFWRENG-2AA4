## How to run the product

_This section needs to be edited to reflect how the user can interact with thefeature released in your project_

### Installation instructions

This product is handled by Maven, as a multi-module project. We assume here that you have cloned the project in a directory named `A2`

To install the different tooling on your computer, simply run:

```
mosser@azrael A2 % mvn install
```

After installation, you'll find an application named `generator.jar` in the `generator` directory, and a file named `visualizer.jar` in the `visualizer` one.

### Generator

To run the generator, go to the `generator` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product takes up to 4 arguments. Whether it is a regular grid or an irregular mesh, the number of polygons in the mesh, the number of times the irregular mesh should be relaxed and the name of the file where the generated mesh will be stored as binary.

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd generator
mosser@azrael generator % java -jar generator.jar sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator % ls -lh sample.mesh
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    29K 29 Jan 10:52 sample.mesh
mosser@azrael generator %
```

```
usage: Generator [OPTIONS] grid/irregular
 -h,--help               Display help
 -n,--polygons <arg>     Number of Polygons
 -o,--fileName <arg>     Output File Name
 -r,--relaxation <arg>   Relaxation Level
```

### Visualizer

To visualize an existing mesh, go the the `visualizer` directory, and use `java -jar` to run the product. The product take three arguments: the file containing the mesh, the name of the file to store the visualization (as an SVG image) and whether it is in debug mode (-X for debug mode).

```
mosser@azrael A2 % cd visualizer
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../generator/sample.mesh sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer % java -jar visualizer.jar ../island/island.mesh sample.svg

... (lots of debug information printed to stdout) ...

mosser@azrael visualizer % ls -lh sample.svg
-rw-r--r--  1 mosser  staff    56K 29 Jan 10:53 sample.svg
mosser@azrael visualizer %
```

To viualize the SVG file:

-   Open it with a web browser
-   Convert it into something else with tool slike `rsvg-convert`

### Island

## How to contribute to the project

When you develop features and enrich the product, remember that you have first to `package` (as in `mvn package`) it so that the `jar` file is re-generated by maven.
